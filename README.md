## About Me

I am a 2nd year MSPPM student who is very excited to learn more in this class! I use he/him pronouns. I'm not used to this style of schooling. I'm used to more policy focused courses and work, but I certainly need to branch out. I never thought I'd be the type of person who needs to make a GitHub. I'm also from Erie, PA. I love the city I'm from, and would suggest anyone in the Pittsburgh area should go up and visit for a day! 

## What I Hope to Learn

- How to frame data in the best way to tell the story I need to 
- The best use of colors possible
- How to use Tableau and other graphic-making platforms

#### OECD data- Government Debt to GDP Ratio, 2017
All of this data comes from this original chart from the OECD itself-

#### Grid Chart of OECD data

#### Donut Chart of OECD data
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7255764"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Choosing the Donut Chart may be a bit silly, and a bit of a risk. Inherently, the Donut chart is similar to the pie chart and should be used as a part of a whole, which I do agree with. My goal was to have a form of data, not in bar-chart form (or another form adjacent to the line graph grid and bar charts, such as columns) that would show the sizes between the OECD countries. The goal isn't to tell a story with the source data, but in my donut chart I felt that the size and labels of the countries gave a size comparison in a way I most enjoyed in flourish. 

When it comes to the data listed in the first chart under the Data Visualization tab, the best way of viewing it is the first two things listed here. They accurately show the size of govt debt in a way that allows you to gather informaiton it wants you to know quickly. I'm understanding the positives and negatives of flourish. When withheld from all the options I'd be hoping for, it makes needing to choose a graphic more difficult.
