## About Me

I am a 2nd year MSPPM student who is very excited to learn more in this class! I use he/him pronouns. I'm not used to this style of schooling. I'm used to more policy focused courses and work, but I certainly need to branch out. I never thought I'd be the type of person who needs to make a GitHub. I'm also from Erie, PA. I love the city I'm from, and would suggest anyone in the Pittsburgh area should go up and visit for a day! 

## What I Hope to Learn

- How to frame data in the best way to tell the story I need to 
- The best use of colors possible
- How to use Tableau and other graphic-making platforms
