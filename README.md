## About Me

I am a 2nd year MSPPM student at Carnegie Mellon University and I use he/him pronouns. This work is from my "Telling Stories with Data" class, where I learned how to create compelling naratives using data visualizations. I enjoy going through these projects because you can see how much I've grown. My first visualizations were rough, but I'm really content with my final shorthand and the narrative it had built. This class taught me a lot about what gains the human attention, how to hold it, and to make sure your audience is with you the whole way. I'm now confident I can build compelling data visualizations in the future! 

Feel free to look at my progress. Don't judge too hard on the first visualization!
