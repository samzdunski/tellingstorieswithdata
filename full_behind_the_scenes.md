# The Behind the Scenes Story
### Part 1
I plan on completing this final project through Shorthand. After weighing all of my options pretty carefully, I plan on going with the option that I feel is safest. Obviously I am most familiar with powerpoint, but this medium could allow me to use some bad habits as a crutch and is, overall, not very engaging. Certainly, it would also not be the most appealing to employers as well. From what I have heard in class, shorthand is the most common medium that students choose. I feel it may be best to follow the pack here! Furthermore, Shorthand looks intuitive and, my favorite part, requires no coding! Other mentioned media, such as VR, video, and as mentioned in class "interpretive dance" all seem like fun and novel opportunities. Unfortunately, none of these fit my strengths!

Besides shorthand, I plan on creating most of my charts in Tableau. I've enjoyed learning about Tableau throughout the course and feel I'm getting a good handle on it. Some visualizations I'm hoping to create may need to be created outside of Tableau, I'm not sure yet. Particularly, in regards to how long plastic takes to decompose, I feel a pictograph (indicating that 1 water bottle = 1 century, per say) would actually be a good way of building the data up. I may also take another look at flourish if I need something simple done!

I'm excited to dive further into Shorthand. After seeing presentations in the beginning of class, I'm eager to see what I can make with the system. I'm anxious about how much I need to learn about the platform in a short amount of time, but I'm hoping the selling point of it being "easy to learn" will ring true.

I will further study all data that is offered on ourworldindata.org and also look into more data to make sure I'm making the strongest case possible. A professor of mine from my undergraduate career has done much of the original research discovering how widespread microplastics were, so contacting her would not be a poor idea (or even just using her research!). Besides this, I will be involved in writing my script, timing my presentation, and learning as much as I can in the process!
### Part 2
User research-

Here are the questions I asked in my interviews

What is this visualization going for?

Do you have any issues with it outright?

What do you like about it?

Do you find anything confusing?

What do you want to know more of after you see this?

Any random comments?

I interviewed three people. I'll describe them all using an alias for each, and give background on what type of person they are.

Interview 1- Kent. Kent is a student in the MSPPM program who has experience with data visualization. I elected to interview him because he fit my target audience well- which is those people in the class I'll be presenting to. Kent also has experience with giving presentations and a great resource for this. His expertise is not in environmental matters, so ensuring this can reach the target audience is key.

Interview 2- Melissa. Melissa is also a student in the MSPPM program with exeperience in data visualization. Her expertise, though, is not presentations. She fits another segment of my target audience, which is those in the class. Between these two, I feel I cover the bases of ensuring my storyboard and wireframes will reach my audience. J

Interview 3- Justin. Justin is a 23 year old HVAC worker who doesn't have experience in data visualization, giving presentations, or environmental issues. Interviewing Justin allowed me to understand how my presentation would be viewed to the general public. He's unlike my target audience in that he isn't a graduate student, but he's helpful in ensuring my visualizations can be understood.

Kent's comments were supremely helpful. He liked the first bowl of plastic, he thought it was a visceral way to show how we actually are just constantly consuming it. He also liked the historical comparisons when showing how long the plastic will be around and the infographic on plastic alternatives. For criticisms, I noticed he wished that fonts on many of the charts were bigger and darker. Reviewing this, I totally agree! In going back, I will ensure that the fonts are readable in the shorthand format. Although they are readable in Tableau, the technological transfer into Shorthand is one I will need to be more aware of.

Melissa was enthralled by the story and felt there was a some missing things she wanted to know. She wanted to know more about what plastic does to our bodies. She was also confused about the historic comparisons of how long these plastics will take to decompose. She didn't know why it was necessarily a problem that causes urgency, which I can definitely do a better job showing about why the buildup of plastic is worrying. She suggested switching to "Which great-great-great-great-great-great grandchild will continue to see the plastic we create?", which I like much better.

Justin's comments were efficient and short. He didn't really have too much to say. He echoed some of what Kent was saying, especially in that the fonts should be bigger and darker. In his words, Justin was "able to learn a lot from the information in a short amount of time." To take a teachable moment away from Justin, it's that you can't force interest in your presentation no matter what. I could tell that Justin wasn't the most interested, which is fine. Even with something as consequential as this, he kind of just wanted to go back to living his normal life and drift away from the information.

In summary, when I complete the rest for the final presentation, I will go back in Tableau and make sure the graphics are more readable in Shorthand. Also, I may consider adding more visualizations (or switching some visualizations) in Canva. My infographics have been popular, while the response to graphs has been muted. This is honestly a good lesson to learn. If you want people interested, bringing out a more artisitc side is vital and useful. Graphs may be great for getting a lot of information in a short amount of time. Also, I'll be sure to add a call to action!
### Part 3
Since part 2, my major changes were included in what I explained back then through my user feedback. I made fonts more readable, first and foremost. I also added Melissa's suggestion of adding, in the comparison of what 500 years looks like, your "great-great-great-great... .grandchildren will be dealing with your plastic pollution" suggestion. I really thought it made sense- and it was surprising. 19 generations after you may be picking up your plastic pollution! I also remembered to put in a call-to-action, as I had forgotten on my first run-through! My most striking statistic- that all 47 human organ samples had evidence of microplastic accumulation- I put directly at the beginning of the shorthand. This attention-grabber, I feel, helped me keep my audience throughout the presentation and drove forward my story-goal of how invasive plastics can be in our lives. 

I focused on a few things that weren't suggested in my feedback sessions. Similar to the moodboards mentioned in class, I found a collection of images in Unsplash that had to deal with plastic that I liked the color scheme of. The overall color-focus was "plastic washed up on the beach". I liked the way it looked in the end, and I think it came together to make an aesthetically pleasing presentation.

Lastly, I added a couple graphs that I thought helped tie things in. The first graph I added was "Global Plastic Production by Year". I had this graph (somewhat) in an infographic that I also kept in the shorthand, the one that speaks on sperm counts, but I thought that a separate graph helped add to the "drowning in plastic" story I was trying to sell. It's an intimidating graph to look at! Lastly, I included a graph on what countries the majority of the mismanaged plastic waste come from, to draw in a better understanding of potential actors and systems that could be the best intervention points for fighting the plastic crisis.
