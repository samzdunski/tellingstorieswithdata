[My wireframe/storyboard done in Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/3c0qREsrKPKftKd0)

User research-

Here are the questions I asked in my interviews

1.  What is this visualization going for?


2. Do you have any issues with it outright?


3. What do you like about it?


4. Do you find anything confusing?


5. What do you want to know more of after you see this?


6. Any random comments?

I interviewed three people. I'll describe them all using an alias for each, and give background on what type of person they are. 

Interview 1- Kent. Kent is a student in the MSPPM program who has experience with data visualization. I elected to interview him because he fit my target audience well- which is those people in the class I'll be presenting to. Kent also has experience with giving presentations and a great resource for this. His expertise is not in environmental matters, so ensuring this can reach the target audience is key. 

Interview 2- Melissa. Melissa is also a student in the MSPPM program with exeperience in data visualization. Her expertise, though, is not presentations. She fits another segment of my target audience, which is those in the class. Between these two, I feel I cover the bases of ensuring my storyboard and wireframes will reach my audience. J

Interview 3- Justin. Justin is a 23 year old HVAC worker who doesn't have experience in data visualization, giving presentations, or environmental issues. Interviewing Justin allowed me to understand how my presentation would be viewed to the general public. He's unlike my target audience in that he isn't a graduate student, but he's helpful in ensuring my visualizations can be understood. 

Kent's comments were supremely helpful. He liked the first bowl of plastic, he thought it was a visceral way to show how we actually are just constantly consuming it. He also liked the historical comparisons when showing how long the plastic will be around and the infographic on plastic alternatives. For criticisms, I noticed he wished that fonts on many of the charts were bigger and darker. Reviewing this, I totally agree! In going back, I will ensure that the fonts are readable in the shorthand format. Although they are readable in Tableau, the technological transfer into Shorthand is one I will need to be more aware of.

Justin's comments were efficient and short. He didn't really have too much to say. He echoed some of what Kent was saying, especially in that the fonts should be bigger and darker. In his words, Justin was "able to learn a lot from the information in a short amount of time." To take a teachable moment away from Justin, it's that you can't force interest in your presentation no matter what. I could tell that Justin wasn't the most interested, which is fine. Even with something as consequential as this, he kind of just wanted to go back to living his normal life and drift away from the information. 

In summary, when I complete the rest for the final presentation, I will go back in Tableau and make sure the graphics are more readable in Shorthand. Also, I may consider adding more visualizations (or switching some visualizations) in Canva. My infographics have been popular, while the response to graphs has been muted. This is honestly a good lesson to learn. If you want people interested, bringing out a more artisitc side is vital and useful. Graphs may be great for getting a lot of information in a short amount of time. Also, I'll be sure to add a call to action!
